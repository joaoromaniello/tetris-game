# Tetris game

Attempting to build a tetris using pure Javascript, just to test our knowledge.

## Features

The project is still limited and for a time was forgotten, the desire is to finalize it to work as a standard Tetris, and in addition use the Javascript localStorage to save something like a scoreboard.

## Current state

The project is in an early development state, so not all functions are 100% functional.

*Piece down force  --> - [x]
*Piece rotation  --> - [x]
*Piece stacking on the floor --> - [_]
