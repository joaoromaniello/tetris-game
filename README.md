# Tetris game

Attempting to build a tetris using pure Javascript, just to test my knowledge.

## Features

The project is still limited and for a time was forgotten, the desire is to finalize it to work as a standard Tetris, and in addition use the Javascript localStorage to save something like a scoreboard.
